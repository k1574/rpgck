# rpgck

rpgck - set of utils for simple step-roll-based text RPG system.

rpgck is name of the main util that lets us to know how
sucessful the action was and how much we need to complete it.

Atk value stands for some quality development level
of the acting person: skill, strength, agility etc.

Def value stands for action dificulty level:
lock dificulty (to pick), door durability (to break through), 

Roll is value betwen floats 0 and 1 which stands for
how much you failed the action, i. e. 1 means you
did the action perfectly and 0 that you totally
failed it. 0 and 1 values make fail ANYONE with ANY
skil values, it's supposed to be really rare though.
The value injects some amount of randomness and
shows luck of the player. You can make players
get rolls values in some interval depending on
their character's luck value or anything other anyways.

Dmg stands for maximum possible damage per attack.
This one value works just for rpgdmg util.
